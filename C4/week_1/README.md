* Predicting anomalies using `Time Series` ?
* Usage of `Time Series` ?
    1. We can see how a `sound wave is split into words`. Using machine learning, it becomes possible to train a neural network based on the `time series` to `recognize words or sub words`.
    1. `Time series` prediction can be used to `detect anomalies`.
* What is `Moore's Law` for `Time Series` ?
* Common patterns in time series ?
    1. Trend
    1. Seasonality (Pattern repeating in particular time period)
    1. Combination of both `Trend` and `Seasonality`
    
* What is `Auto Correlations` in Time Series ?
* What is `Non-Stationary Time Series` ?
* What is `Naive Forcasting` ?
* What is `Fixed Partitioning` in `Time Series` ?

* Metrics for evaluating performance ?

* What is `Moving average` in `Time Series` ?
* What is `Differencing` in `Time Series` ?
* What is an example of a Univariate time series ?
    * Hour by hour temperature
* What is an example of a Multivariate time series ?
    * Hour by hour weather 
* What is imputed data ?
    * A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data
* A sound wave is a good example of time series data ?
    * True
* What is Seasonality ?
    * A regular change in shape of the data
* What is a trend ?
    * An overall direction for data regardless of direction
* In the context of time series, what is noise ?
    * Unpredictable changes in time series data
* What is autocorrelation ?
    * Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different
* What is a non-stationary time series ? 
    * One that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality
