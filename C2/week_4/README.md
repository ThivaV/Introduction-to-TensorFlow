* We've come a long way! From first     principles in understanding how ML works, to using a DNN to do basic computer vision, and then beyond into Convolutions.

    With Convolutions, We then saw how to extract features from an image, and We saw the tools in TensorFlow and Keras to build with Convolutions and Pooling as well as handling complex, multi-sized images.

    Through this We saw how overfitting can have an impact on your classifiers, and explored some strategies to avoid it, including Image Augmentation, Dropouts, Transfer Learning and more. To wrap things up, this week We've looked at the considerations in our code that you need for moving towards multi-class classification!.

* `Augmentation`, `Dropouts`, `Regularization` and `Transfer Learning`, and coding considerations between `binary` or `multi-class classification`.
