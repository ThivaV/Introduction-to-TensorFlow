# Week 1

## Exploring a large dataset

* Dataset: [Kaggle - Dog Vs Cat](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
* Explore the training history and discovered an interesting phenomenon: Even though the training data setâ€™s accuracy went very high, we saw that after only a few epochs, the validation set levelled out. This is a clear sign that we are overfitting again. Using more data should help with this, but there are some other techniques that you can use with smaller data sets too.
